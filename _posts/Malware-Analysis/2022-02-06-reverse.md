### Analysis :

when we run the Challenge  and write any thing it will pop this 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\1.PNG)

so we will search for this text in IDA pro we will see this function 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\2.PNG)

in this function we can see it is comparing between to thing (0x40125c) and if not equal it will jump to the incorrect message so we will rename this function to ("check_algo")  and back to function that calling this function 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\3.PNG)

the first screen to this function we will see in offset (4010A6) it checks if the field of user is empty or no we will assumption that the serial Depends on user name this is assumption we are not sure but let's continue 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\4.PNG)

after it check if empty or not it put **user_name** in offset we will call it **offset_of user_name** and then it push the **len** of **user_name** to function i named it before but you should go with code step by step so we will go to this function and see what it is make 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\5.PNG)

this function starts by move pointer to **offset_of user_name** in **esi**  and move offset (**403100**) to **edi** and then make loop with counter = 16 in dec and in every time it take byte from **offset_of user_name** and push it with the number of counter (ecx ) to function (0x4011A9) we will go to this function put before do this we can assumption this function take user_name and make some operation in it and after that compare it with serial but we will see what exactly what it do 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\6.PNG)

we see some operations we don't care about it because it doesn't operate with any important data to us so we will focus from  (4011E9) we see it take the byte we did push it and move it to **eax** and then add it to the counter of loop also we did push  then check if the result is greater than 21h that in ascii equal to (**!**) if not add 21 and if true it will check if the result is lower than 7Bh which also equal to **X** and if not it sheft to right once and if true it will move the result to **eax** so summary of this i will give you example 
assumption  the first char in your name is ("**m**") which in ascii is ("**6D**")

so in first it will add **ecx** which assumption  in this time is 16 dec = 10 h 

so result = 6Dh + 10h = 7Dh

then check 7D > 21 

if false add 21 

if true check 

​		check for 7D < 7B 

​		if true store it in eax 

​		if false shift to right once and then store it 

in our case it will shift so 7Dh after shift will   3Eh = ("**>**")

and then back to function before this  it will do it with every char in **offset**  from **offset_of user_name** to **offset_of user_name + 10h** and store it in offset (**403100**) so this function convert every char but we don't know exactly why so we will back again to this function 

![](/assets\images\crackmes\7.PNG)

we see it take text in serial field and check if empty then push the serial text to **check_algo** function which check every char in serial with offset   

(**403100**) which is converted user_name so our assumption  is true the serial Depends on user name .

so user name  = check
			serial     = swspw,+*)('&%$#"
