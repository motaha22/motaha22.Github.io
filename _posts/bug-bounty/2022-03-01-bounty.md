Hi, I would like to share how I was able to bypass 2FA. This is a private program on Hackerone, so we will call it example.com.


### What is 2FA:

2FA is used as another layer of security to prevent Attackers from accessing the account if the attacker stole the password.

### The Vulnerability:

I went to the website and enabled 2FA, then logged out and try to login again.

The website asked to enter the 2FA code and the url was like:

    https://example.com/react-aspx/Authenticator.aspx
 
An idea came to my mind to enter the url of the dashboard directly which was like:

    https://example.com/home.aspx

and I was able to bypass 2FA and access the account.

Severity: Medium

Bounty: $$$
